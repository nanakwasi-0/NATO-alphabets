# NATO-alphabets

<p>
This is a simple script that shows the conventional NATO alphabets in relation to the english language alphabets. 
As somewhat childish as this may be, I got inspiration from playing Call of Duty growing up.

<h3> Future development of this script. </h3>
<p>When ever a call of duty game is released, The new guns introduced are usually given these NATO code names in battlepasses. I cannot be the only one who sometimes can't immediately tell the gun to which a blueprint is to and in such situations I google the gun and its corresponding NATO codename.
